# AI - Planning

## Optimal Plan

Overall, _A* with the ignore-preconditions heuristic_ performed the fastest - generally due to fewer node expansions, goal tests, and new node creations - among the search algorithms used, while also yielding an optimal path in each case.

The contrast in performance as compared to non-heuristic searches is reflected especially so in larger problems, such as problem # 2 and problem # 3. This is understandable, since non-heuristic searches grow exponentially in size as we expand the frontier of the search at each step.

Problem # 1, however, being smaller (smaller state space and action schema definition), was more amenable to the non-heuristic search methods, and understandably was as performant as the heuristic-based approaches, in terms of the node expansions, goal tests and new node creations, while still guaranteeing optimal plans. Out of these non-heuristic searches, the greedy-best-first-graph search achieved an optimal plan with the fewest number of node expansions, goal tests and new node creations. Consequently, it also performed the fastest. In general, however, the A* searches with the various heuristics were not too far off, and not only achieved optimal plans, but also did that generally as efficiently as the non-heuristic approaches.

Furthermore, in all three problems, the heuristic-based A* searches that eventually completed, all yielded an optimal path of the same length as the optimal path generated by the non-heuristic search results, which is certainly encouraging!

## Comparison of non-heuristic search result metrics (optimality, runtime, node expansions)

Among the non-heuristic-based search algorithms, a simple Breadth First Search seems to have achieved optimal performance both in terms of the plan length and also with the runtime, number of expansions, number of goal tests and new nodes. <Why is this better than UCS?>

### Depth First Search

This algorithm appears to have created the least optimal plans (by a significant margin), amongst all the other search algorithms. However, it achieved this with the fewest node expansions, goal tests and new nodes as compared to the other non-heuristic approaches below. The tradeoff of getting faster performance at the cost of sub-optimal results, however, makes this algorithm the worst choice among the choices.

The reason for sub-optimal results is that the algorithm is sensitive to the order in which the actions are traversed. This algorithm focuses on finding "a" path, rather than finding one of "the" paths from initial to goal states. This explains why the expansions, goal tests, new nodes and runtime for this search algorithm applied to problem # 3 were lower than that for problem # 2, even though the size difference might have suggested the opposite. It is possible that the transitions from initial to goal states for problem # 3 might have been clustered closer to the side of the graph that the depth first search traversed first.

### Breadth First Search

The issue seen with DFS's non-determinism and resulting loss in optimality is not found with breadth-first traversal since all nodes at a given level would be visited before going to the next level, thereby assuring that if a path existed to a goal, the most straightforward/optimal /shortest path would be discovered, rather than just "a" possible path of any length. This ensures that BFS yields optimal solutions. The runtime, node expansions, goal tests and new nodes are understandably more than with DFS.

### Uniform Cost Search

Overall, this algorithm achieved an optimal plan for all 3 problems, with acceptable runtime/node-expansion/new-node/goal-tests counts that were not as optimal as the metrics achieved by BFS. UCS consistently underperformed BFS in terms of these latter 3 metrics. <This make ssense because..?>

## Comparison & contrast of A* heuristic search result metrics
* Ignore preconditions:  In all 3 problems, A* with the ignore-preconditions heuristic yielded optimal results in a highly performant manner.
* Level sum: A* with the level-sum heuristic took > 10 mins for problems 2 and 3. Though it yielded an optimal solution for problem 1, it did not bet the performance of A* with the ignore-preconditions heuristic for the same problem.

### What was the best heuristic?

A* with the ignore-preconditions heuristic, was the best performing path planning search agent across the domain of non-heuristic-based and heuristic-based algorithms, barring an exceptional performance by the greedy-best-first-search algorithm for problem 1. A* with the ignore-preconditions heuristic not only consistently achieved optimal plans for each of the 3 problems, it also did so with significantly less runtime, node expansions, goal tests and new nodes, when compared to those metrics across the other algorithms (with the exception of the greedy-best-first-search algorithm that performed the best for problem 1). Considering however, that problem 1 was smaller and more amenable to an exhaustive search, A* with ignore-preconditions seems to shine far more in cases where the problem has a larger state space and action schema.

## Heuristic vs Non-heuristic search comparison

In general, the non-heuristic-based search algorithms guarantee optimal planning, but at heavy performance cost. For instance, for both problems 2 and 3, three of the non-heuristic based algorithms not mentioned above (i.e, Breadth First Tree Search, Depth Limited Search, and Recursive Best First Search) took > 10 mins. The only non-heuristic-based search algorithms to not guarantee optimal planning were the Greedy-Best-First-Graph-Search, the Depth-First-Graph-Search and the Depth-Limited-Search algorithms. This makes sense for the first algorithm because <……>, and as for the latter two algorithms, their performance makes sense too, since the depth-first approach is not well suited to this type of problem anyway.

Heuristic-based search algorithms, on the other hand, tended to yield an optimal plan for all three problems, with the exception of the A* with level-sum heuristic, that took > 10 mins for problems 2 and 3. Considering that 3 out of the 7 non-heuristic-based search algorithms took > 10 mins for problems 2 and 3, 1 out of 3 for the heuristic-based search algorithms is a pretty good performance improvement without sacrificing optimal planning. Of course, these are best-effort algorithms, so cannot be guaranteed to converge on the optimal solution, but for the majority of cases, as with problems 1, 2 and 3, they were sufficient.
